### Powdery mildew predictor

#### Introduction

Powdery mildew is a fungal infection that affects a wide range of plants, including the cherry plant. Infection with powdery mildew can cause a white or grayish coating on the leaves of infected plants and sometimes the fruit. The fungus spreads through airborne spores and thrives in humid conditions.
Infection of plants with powdery mildew can negatively affect the overall functioning of the plant, including disrupting photosynthesis. This can result in stunting of growth of the plant as well as overall quality and yield of the fruit. 

Powdery mildew can spread easily between infected plants via physical contact with infected plants or fungal airborne spores. Therefore, early detection of powdery mildew infection is vital to preserve the overall quality of the crop.

Our client, a cherry farmer, is interested in creating a tool to accurately detect whether a cherry leaf is infected with powdery mildew or not in order to allow effective infection monitoring of their crops.

We have developed a machine learning tool to predict whether a cherry leaf is infected with powdery mildew or not. The tool has been deployed and can be accessed by following this [link](https://powdery-mildew-predictor-1becb7613bb9.herokuapp.com/).

We followed the Cross-industry Standard process for Data-Mining (CRISP-DM) structure frameworks to guide our steps involved in this machine learning project.
